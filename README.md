# Astro-Quiz

How much do you know about the Universe?

This little quiz is designed to give you the answer to that question. The main goal is to test your knowledge about astronomical subjects.
For demonstration purposes, this quiz is limited to seven questions.
Regardless of the difficulty level of the questions, the audiences of different ages can be targeted.

## Intro

## UX
Because this is a multiple-choice question method.
(A multiple-choice item consists of a problem, known as the stem, and a list of suggested solutions, known as alternatives.)

The user knows in advance that at least one choice is correct.
Even with deductive reasoning, the answers can be guessed because there is only one best answer.

There are actual counters built in to keep track of the correct and incorrect answers, and the questions that are unanswered are counted.

## User Story
In classical multiple-choice game play, points are granted for correct answers, and if answers are wrong, points can be penalized.
When answers are not given, there are points to be gained.

## Features/Heading
The answers are embedded into multiple-choice buttons to give a more smooth user experience

As an extra feature, social media links are built into external links and other media platforms.

Timer is required to level up the User Experience and higher cognitive thinking is required.
